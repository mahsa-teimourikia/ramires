# RAMIRES

RAMIRES is a tool for automated risk management in Industry 4.0 using sensor data. This project has been developed as part of my PhD thesis. The codes shared here are only a small part of the project where it attempts to create a dashboard for risk management, visualizing the risks that have been detected in the environment, and letting the risk management team interviene whenever necessary.

The results of the research and the details on the algorithms and methods used have been published in various conferences and journals and can be found in the following:
